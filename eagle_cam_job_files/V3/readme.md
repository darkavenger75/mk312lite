## Update
- BOM edited to include JLCPCB part numbers such that automatic part selection should work from the start
- CPL edited to fix rotation of components
- Some extended parts replaced by basic parts for lower cost. Further cost reduction by replacing the logic-level MOSFETs IRLL2705 by AO3400 possible. 
- Display brightness pot removed due to being ineffective
