## Board ordering instructions

PCB
- Default settings by JLCPCB work fine. Feel free to choose different color, etc. Lead-free recommended for the sake of the environment.

Assembly
- Economic, Bottom side, as many PCBs as you wish (minimum 2). "Confirm Parts Placement" recommended. 
- Automatic selection of parts after uploading BOM and CPL workes well, but better check for errors. 
- Check part placement and rotation, esp. ATmega, MOSFETs and 5V DC/DC converter.
